- Features:
  - The SDK now needs an initialization key to contact the Hive, [See there](/en/1.5.0/guide/dashboard/#handle-private-crop).
  - You can now upload media ([video](/en/1.5.0/stings/form/formPage.html#video), [audio](/en/1.5.0/stings/form/formPage.html#sound), and [pictures](/en/1.5.0/stings/form/formPage.html#picture)) from _form_.
  - Needed runtime permissions for _Android M_ are now declared per Sting, you can see required and missing runtime permissions for each crop.
  - You can write scripts to process each uploaded data block before insertion in database. [More info over here](/en/1.5.0/guide/dashboard/#filter-uploaded-data).
- Enhancements:
  - The SDK will now automatically log out users whose session has become invalid.
  - The Honeycomb UI has been refactored, hope you like it better.
