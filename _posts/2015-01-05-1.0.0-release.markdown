We are glad to annonce the first release of our APISENSEÂ® SDK.
With it you can collect data from most common smartphone sensors on Android and iOS and retrieve data later! This is the very first step to our project but we think there is a lot of things you can already do.

Be sure to share with us your impressions so we can make it better :D

Hope you like it!
